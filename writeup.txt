I had two challenges, a major one and a minor one. My major challenge was passing the input file as an argument. This was the first time I will use VSCode to write an executable from scratch and I had issues with debugging my program. I work best when I break large problems into smaller ones which is why I like Jupyter a lot. So, I shipped my codes to different cells in my notebook, hard coded the file paths and ran my codes. I figured out that the major issue was with my write_tag function. I consulted StackOverFlow when I was trying to figure out how to debug my program. I got an insight which I used to debug my program. I ran the program and it worked. Afterwards, I copied the codes from my notebook and pasted them back to my VS Code. Then I replaced the hard coded file paths with their respective argument parsers. I ran my script through the command line interface and it worked.

The minor challenge was coming up with a one line description of the program. I was not sure if to include or omit more details. How to decide which information is important and how to make my description concise enough. It looks pretty simple but initially, it was not for me.
